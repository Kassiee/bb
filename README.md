# BB

Bad Build - weird and poorly coded C++ project for a very small build system cause I've had enough of cmake and meson :p (VERY EARLY W.I.P)

### **requirements**:

- clang (>=17.0.x) [or gcc, compiler can be changed in build.sh]

simply run the build.sh script to build and compile the project
