Bad Build - weird and poorly coded C++ project for a very small build system cause I've had enough of cmake and meson :p (W.I.P)

The build.py file is a simple script made to build the project, but can be used by itself in anything else

### **requirements**:

- python (>=3.10)
- clang (>=17.0.x) [or gcc, compiler can be changed in build.py]

simply run the build.py script to build and compile the project
